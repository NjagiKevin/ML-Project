    # %(asctime)s: The timestamp when the log entry was created.
    # %(lineno)d: The line number where the log entry was generated.
    # %(name)s: The name of the logger or module.
    # %(levelname)s: The severity level of the log (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, etc.).
    # %(message)s: The actual log message.
# level=logging.INFO: This sets the logging level to INFO, meaning only log messages with this level or higher will be recorded (e.g., INFO, WARNING, ERROR).

# This script configures logging to write messages to a dynamically generated log file. 
# The log file is stored in a "logs" directory, 
# and the format of the log messages includes important details like timestamps 
# and the severity level of the messages.
